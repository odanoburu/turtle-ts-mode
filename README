#+TITLE: RDF Turtle Tree-sitter mode for Emacs

A simple tree-sitter major mode for HTML and Emacs >29.

See this [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter][walkthrough]] for how to setup Emacs with tree-sitter. You will
need the [[https://github.com/GordianDziwis/tree-sitter-turtle/][Tree-sitter grammar for RDF Turtle]]:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist '(turtle "https://github.com/GordianDziwis/tree-sitter-turtle"))
#+end_src

Then clone this repo somewhere in your Emacs load-path. I recommend
creating a directory for your Emacs packages that are not managed by
any package manager, and then adding all of its subdirectories to your
load-path. Then all you have to do is git clone this package in this
directory, and load it.
#+begin_src elisp
  (let ((default-directory "~/.config/emacs/my-pkgs/"))
    (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

  (use-package turtle-ts-mode)
#+end_src
